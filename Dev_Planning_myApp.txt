To-Do:
a) Post a message to the system - without an explicit server side call'
	- Assume that explicit server side call --> NO server side call
	- Client side call only simulates data
		* Need a sync with server --> Method.call() still required to write to server
		* Button call client side method, client side method call server side API
		* Use events --> 'submit .new-task'(event)
		
b) Delete a message they own from the system, **ONLY** using a server side call
	- use a server side call --> Method.call()
	
c) see a list of the messages to the system in order of the date posted.
	- Does not specify user authentication --> everything in database will be displayed --> collection.find();
	
d) If you need to create a signup form to do this, then do so - if not, great. 
	- Avoid signup/login
		* Try publications and privacy --> this.userId works when no login?
		* If not, user provides code for authentication --> SHA256, then saved in database when posting)
